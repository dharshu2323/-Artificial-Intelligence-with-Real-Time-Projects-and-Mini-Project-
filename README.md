Hello Technophile!! Welcome to my GitHub profile.If you visit my profile on GitHub, youâ€™ll notice that it contains images that is image recognition using machine learning. I have done a currency recognition of 3 different nations.
In our world there are many currency notes it is difficult to identify where it belongs.I have done a project on it.
It's a teamwork project.
To begin with the project I have imported the libraries such as #skimage which is useful to extract the features and to recognize them.I have imported the currency images of China, Indonesia, and Norway.To recognize them I have converted them # into greyscale and then resized and reshaped them. I found the edges of the images using SOBEL.Then I merged the three data frames into a single data frame and shuffled them its purpose is to break possible biases during data preparation. Then I found accuracy and metices of the images. Metrics are used to monitor and measure the performance of a model. This is my project Hope u like it. Thank you
